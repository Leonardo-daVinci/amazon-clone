1. After making the StateProvider.js file, we wrap our <App/>
2. InitialState is what does the data layer look like in the beginning and reducer is how we want to manipulate the data
3. Create reducer.js and define the initialState and reducer
4. Now we need to connect actions in reducer with respective components
